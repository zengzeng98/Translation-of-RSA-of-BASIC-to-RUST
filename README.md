Got this christmas gift picture from my professor Thorsten Koch @ZIB about translating it to RUST. And it is very interesting:p
And only after translation can I understand why this language(at that time) is so hatred for someone like Dijkstra who values structure very much?
But anyway I can imagine how fancinating it was at that time, when you finished your own first programm, the starship flied in the screen. Cold war,
Famicom, BRD, DDR, and the time
